# advxs-antagonism-figs
Repository to produce the figures in the article entitled "Fooling the classifier: Ligand antagonism and adversarial examples"

We have developed the idea that the phenomenon of adversarial examples and ligand antagonism are instances of the same general concept of fooling a decision-maker. The scripts reproduce the figures in the paper. By playing with parameters you can get a feeling for the involved dynamics yourself. We encourage attempts in producing a similar MTL -> ML image that demonstrates robust adversarial defence, and are looking forward to more examples of adversarial/ambiguous boundary images.
