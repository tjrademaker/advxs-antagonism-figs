Repository to produce the figures in the article entitled "Fooling the classifier: Ligand antagonism and adversarial examples"

Hi there,

I am a graduate student in the Fran√ßois lab at McGill University http://www.mcgill.ca/francois-group, and with my advisor I have developed the idea that the phenomenon of adversarial examples and ligand antagonism are instances of the general concept of fooling the classifier. The scripts here reproduce the figures in the paper. By playing with parameters you can get a feel for the involved dynamics.
